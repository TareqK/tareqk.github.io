My Name is Tareq Kirresh. Im a simple man trying to find my way in the universe.
I've always been a craftsman at heart. Im very passionate about technology, 
and am especially interested in the fields of Logistics, Emergency Services,
and Automation - passions that were imprinted in me from family business and
home life. Currently, I am a Software Engineer by trade, and I am working on 
my master's degree in software Engineering. Full of energy, empathy, and coffee.


I always enjoyed tinkering around, 
dissasembling and putting stuff back together, ever since I was a kid. My 
earliest memories were of me in the repair shop at my father's company - going
about the job of polishing up Headsets before they go out to customers, because
we dont ship things half done, then moving up to repair when as soon as they 
would let me hold a soldering iron. Ive always had pride in my work and
my life

Im also a big fan of culinary arts, specifically, in the areas of fermentation,
baking, and preservation - this plays nicely with my love of tech, as I find
myself often using my tinkering skills to create new tools to help me do those
things. Its always fun to spend a weekend in the kitchen, just going at it with
new recipies, cures, and techniques. 

Im a big open source advocate. I am part of the local [Palestinian Open Source
Community](https://palosc.org), and handle organization and professional outreach
for the group.
